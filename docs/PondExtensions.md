# Pond changes

The mod allows for two pond changes:

## Non-fish in ponds
This allows any **Object** to be placed in a pond, as long as they have the custom field `"mistyspring.ItemExtensions/AllowFishPond": "true"`

## Disable fish jumping
You can disable fish's jumping- just add the following to custom fields:

`"mistyspring.ItemExtensions/DisableFishJump": "true"`.
